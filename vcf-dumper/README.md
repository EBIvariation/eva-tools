# European Variation Archive (EVA) VCF dumper

The VCF dumper is a web service that supports some queries from the [EVA core REST Webservices API](https://github.com/EBIvariation/eva-ws/wiki#variants) and writes the output in [VCF format](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf "VCF format specification")

## Build
In order to build the VCF dumper, you need to install the Java Development Kit 8 and Maven.

The project dependencies are in maven central, excluding OpenCGA. You can get OpenCGA 0.5.2 from https://github.com/opencb/opencga, branch `hotfix/0.5`. Please follow the download/compilation instructions there.
